# About me
I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented cybersecurity analyst.
Protecting people's personal information, especially their financial security, is something that really interests me.
By spotting any security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities and ensuring that assets are readily available, private, and of the highest caliber, I'm thrilled to assist a company in protecting its data and information. This will benefit the nation and increase public confidence.
